Prior to Colins and Young, Patrick worked as a landman for several small oil and gas companies.
                                   
                                        <br><br>Active in the oil and gas community, Patrick is on the Executive Committee and a former President of the Dallas Producers Club, on the board of directors of the Dallas Wildcat Committee, a member of the IPAA, the ADAM Energy Forum, and the Dallas Chapter of Young Professionals in Energy. He was featured in the April 2011 Oil and Gas Investor as a "Bright Spot", highlighting young professionals in the industry.&nbsp;<br><br>
                                        Originally from Midland and later raised in Dallas, Patrick and his wife, Lindsey, are active in many arts organizations both within and outside of Texas. Patrick is a Trustee of the Dallas Museum of Art, The SMU Meadows School of the Arts, the Fort Worth Modern Museum of Art, and the Chinati Foundation in Marfa, Texas. Mr. Collins also sits on the Program Advisory Committee of the Nasher Sculpture Center and the Leadership Council of the Dia Art Foundation and was formerly on the Board of the Contemporary Austin. Lindsey sits on the Boards of Glasstire and CineMarfa.<br><br>
                                        Patrick has an MBA from the Action School of Business, and a BA with honors from Columbia University. He lives in Dallas with his wife and three children.
